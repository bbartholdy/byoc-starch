<!-- basic introduction to the field, comprehensible to a scientist in any discipline -->
<!-- Dental calculus is mineralised plaque. And it is pretty cool. -->
Dental calculus has proven to contain a wealth of 
dietary information in the form of plant microfossils 
[@henryCalculusSyria2008; @hardyStarchGranulesDental2009], 
proteins [@hendyProteomicCalculus2018; @warinnerEvidenceMilk2014],
and other organic residues [@buckleyDentalCalculus2014]. 
This dietary information can be preserved within the mineralised dental plaque 
over many millennia, providing a unique window into the food-related behaviours of 
past populations 
[@henryCalculusSyria2008; @jovanovicNeolithicCalculus2021; @taoWheatCalculus2020] 
and extinct species [@henryNeanderthalCalculus2014; @hardyNeanderthalMedics2012]. 

<!-- more detailed background, comprehensible to scientists in related disciplines -->
Until recently, only a few studies directly investigated the presence of plant
microremains
in the dental calculus of archaeological remains. The ability to extract phytoliths
from the dental calculus of archaeological fauna to investigate diet was first 
noted by Armitage [-@armitageExtractionIdentification1975], 
and later by Middleton and Rovner [-@middletonOpalPhytoliths1994],
and Fox and colleagues [-@foxPhytolithCalculus1996]. Starches and phytoliths were
extracted from human dental calculus by Cummings and Magennis [-@cummingsMayanCalculus1997].  
In more recent years, the study of dental calculus has increased exponentially, 
and the wealth of information contained within the mineralised matrix has largely
been acknowledged. The use of dental calculus spans a wide
variety of archaeological research areas, such as oral microbiome 
characterisation (including pathogens) through the analysis of DNA and proteins 
[@adlerSequencingAncient2013; @warinnerPathogensHost2014],
microbotanical remains [@henryCalculusSyria2008; @hardyStarchGranules2009;
@mickleburghNewInsights2012], 
other organic residues and proteins from dietary compounds 
[@buckleyDentalCalculus2014; @hendyProteomicCalculus2018], 
and nicotine use [@eerkensDentalCalculus2018]. Especially the extraction 
of starch granules has become a rich source of dietary
information, as starch granules have proven to preserve well within dental calculus
over a variety of geographical and temporal ranges 
[@pipernoStarchGrains2008; @henryNeanderthalCalculus2014; @taoWheatCalculus2020;
@jovanovicNeolithicCalculus2021].

<!-- clearly stating the general problem being addressed by this particular study -->
Despite this, our knowledge of dental calculus and the incorporation pathways of 
the various markers is limited [@radiniFoodPathways2017], as is our 
knowledge of information-loss caused by these pathways. Additionally, the methods
we use to extract and analyse dental calculus, and make inferences on past diets
represent another potential source of bias. Studies on both archaeological and
modern individuals have explored these biases in more detail.
Extraction methods were tested 
by Tromp and colleagues [-@trompEDTACalculus2017], specifically regarding
decalcification using HCl or EDTA. 
The authors found significantly more starches with the EDTA extraction method 
than the HCl extraction method; however, as noted by the authors, comparisons 
involving archaeological calculus are problematic due to variability between and 
within individuals. 
Studies conducted on modern humans [@leonardDentalCalculus2015] 
and non-human primates [@powerChimpCalculus2015; @powerRepresentativenessDental2021] 
have explored how well microremains (phytoliths and starches)
extracted from dental calculus represent the actual dietary intake.
These studies are justifiably limited, 
despite meticulous documentation and observation, due to unknown variables and 
uncertainty involved in this kind of *in vivo* research. Dental calculus is a complex 
oral biofilm with a multifactorial aetiology and variable formation rates both 
within and between individuals [@jepsenCalculusRemoval2011; @haffajeeBiofilmPosition2009], 
contributing to
the stochasticity of starch representation being observed in numerous studies.
Additionally, the concentration of oral $\alpha$-amylase differs both between and
within individuals [@froehlichEffectOral1987; @naterHumanAmylase2005],
causing different rates of hydrolysis of the starch granules present in the oral
cavity. Add to this the effects of the many different methods
of starch processing [@hardyRecoveringInformation2018], as well as post-depositional
processes that are still being explored
[@graneroStarchTaphonomy2020; @mercaderExaggeratedExpectations2018],
and it becomes clear that using 
dental calculus to reconstruct diet is a highly unpredictable process.

In this exploratory study, we use an oral biofilm model to investigate the 
retention of starch granules within dental calculus in a controlled laboratory 
setting, allowing us full control over dietary input. Our main questions concern
the representation of granules extracted
from the calculus compared to the actual intake. How much of the original diet is 
incorporated into the calculus, and how much is recovered? 
Is there differential loss of information from specific dietary markers that affects 
the obtained dietary information, and how does this affect the representation of 
diet from extracted microremains?  
We find that, despite the absence of $\alpha$-amylase in
the model, a limited proportion of the starch input is actually 
retained in the calculus. We also observed a shift in the size ratios of individual 
starch granules that are incorporated into the calculus, and that the number of 
incorporated starch granules increases as the size of the calculus deposit 
increases.
