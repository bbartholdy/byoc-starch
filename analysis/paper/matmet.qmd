### Biofilm formation

In this study we employ a multispecies oral biofilm model following a modified
protocol from Sissons and colleagues [-@sissonsMultistationPlaque1991] and
Shellis [-@shellisSyntheticSaliva1978]. In brief, a biofilm inoculated
with whole saliva was grown on a substrate suspended in artificial saliva, and
fed with sugar (sucrose). After several days of growth, the biofilm was exposed
to starch solutions. Mineralisation of the biofilm was aided by exposure to a
calcium phosphate solution. After 25 days of growth, the mineralised biofilm was
collected for further analysis. The setup comprises a polypropylene 
24 deepwell PCR plate (KingFisher 97003510) with a lid containing 24 pegs, which 
is autoclaved at 120&deg;C, 1 bar overpressure, for 20 mins. The individual pegs 
were the substrata on which the calculus grew. Using this system allowed for easy
transfer of the growing biofilm between saliva, feeding solutions, 
and mineral solutions.

The artificial saliva (AS) is a modified version of the basal medium mucin (BMM)
described by Sissons and colleagues [-@sissonsMultistationPlaque1991]. 
It contains 2.5 g/l partially purified mucin from porcine stomach (Type III, Sigma M1778), 
5 g/l trypticase peptone (Roth 2363.1), 10 g/l proteose peptone (Oxoid LP0085),
5 g/l yeast extract (BD 211921), 2.5 g/l KCl, 0.35 g/l NaCl, 1.8 mmol/l CaCl~2~, 
5.2 mmol/l Na~2~HPO~4~ [@sissonsMultistationPlaque1991], 6.4 mmol/l NaHCO~3~ 
[@shellisSyntheticSaliva1978], 2.5 mg/l haemin. This is subsequently 
adjusted to pH 7 with NaOH pellets and stirring, autoclaved (15 min, 120&deg;C, 
1 bar overpressure), and supplemented with 5.8 $\mu$mol/l menadione, 5 mmol/l urea, 
and 1 mmol/l arginine [@sissonsMultistationPlaque1991].

Fresh whole saliva (WS) for inoculation was provided by a 31-year-old<!--needless to say I am much older now...--> male donor 
with no history of caries, who abstained from oral hygiene for 24 hours. No 
food was consumed two hours prior to donation and no antibiotics were taken up 
to six months prior to donation. 
The saliva was filtered through a sterilised (with sodium hypochlorite, 10--15% active chlorine) 
nylon cloth to remove particulates.
Substrata were inoculated with 1 ml/well of a two-fold dilution of WS in sterilised 
20% (v/v) glycerine for four hours at 36&deg;C, to allow attachment of the
salivary pellicle and plaque-forming bacteria. After initial inoculation, the 
substrata were transferred to a new plate containing 1 ml/well AS and incubated 
in a shaking incubator (Infors HT Ecotron) at 36&deg;C, 30 rpm. 
The inoculation process was repeated on days 3 and 5. 
AS was partially refreshed once per day and fully refreshed every three days, 
throughout the experiment, by transferring the substrata to a new plate containing 
stock AS. To feed the bacteria, the substrata were transferred to a new plate, containing 
5% (w/v) sucrose, for six minutes twice daily, except on inoculation days 
(days 0, 3, and 5), where the samples only received one sucrose treatment after
inoculation. 

Starch treatments were initiated on day 9 to avoid starch granule counts being 
affected by $\alpha$-amylase hydrolysis from saliva inoculation days. 
An $\alpha$-amylase (EC 3.2.1.1) activity
assay was conducted to confirm that no amylase was present in the model before
starch treatments started. Starch treatments replaced sucrose treatments, occurring twice per day
for six minutes. The starch treatments involved transferring the substrata to a 
new plate containing a 0.25% (w/v) starch from potato (Roth 9441.1) solution, a 0.25% (w/v) starch from wheat (Sigma S5127) solution, and a 0.5% (w/v) mixture of equal
concentrations (w/v) wheat and potato. All starch treatments were created in dH~2~O
with 5% (w/v) sucrose. Before transferring biofilm samples to the starch treatment
plate, the plates were agitated to keep the starches in suspension in the
solutions. During treatments, the rpm was increased to 60 to facilitate contact
between starch granules and biofilms.

After 15 days, mineralisation was encouraged with a 
calcium phosphate monofluorophosphate urea (CPMU) solution containing 
20 mmol/l CaCl~2~, 12 mmol/l NaH~2~PO~4~, 5 mmol/l Na~2~PO~3~F, 500 mmol/l urea, 
and (0.04 g/l MgCl)
[@pearceConcomitantDeposition1987; @sissonsMultistationPlaque1991].
The substrata were submerged in 1 ml/well CPMU for six minutes, five times 
daily, in a two-hour cycle. During the mineralisation period, starch treatments
were reduced to once per day after the five CPMU treatments. This process was repeated 
for 10 days until the end of the experiment on day 24 
(see @fig-protocol for an overview of the protocol).

All laboratory work was conducted in sterile conditions under a laminar flow hood 
to prevent starch and bacterial contamination. Control samples that only received
sucrose as a treatment were included to detect starch contamination from the
environment or cross-contamination from other wells in the same plate.

### Amylase activity detection

An $\alpha$-amylase (EC 3.2.1.1) activity assay was conducted on artificial
saliva samples collected from the plate wells on days 3, 6, 8, 9, 10, 12, and 14. 
Whole saliva samples were collected on days 0, 3, and 5 as positive controls.
Collected samples were stored at 4&deg;C until the assay was conducted on day 18. 
All samples and standard curves were run in triplicates on two separate plates.
Positive control saliva samples were compared against a standard curve containing 
H~2~O, while artificial saliva samples were compared against a standard curve
containing stock AS (due to the colour of artificial saliva).
Two photometric readings were conducted for each plate with a 540 nm filter on a 
Multiskan FC Microplate Photometer (Thermo Scientific 51119000). 
The protocol is a modified version of an Enzymatic Assay of $\alpha$-Amylase
(<https://www.sigmaaldrich.com/NL/en/technical-documents/protocol/protein-biology/enzyme-activity-assays/enzymatic-assay-of-a-amylase>) [@bernfeldAmylase1955], which measures the amount of
maltose released from starch by $\alpha$-amylase activity. Results are reported
in units (U) per mL enzyme, where 1 U releases 1 $\mu$mole of maltose in 6 minutes.
The detailed protocol can be found here: <https://www.protocols.io/view/amylase-activity-bw8jphun>.

### Treatment solutions

A 1 ml aliquot of each starch solution was taken, from which 10 $\mu$l was mounted 
on a microscope slide with an 18 x 18 mm coverslip, and counted under a light microscope
(Zeiss Axioscope A1). For wheat and mixed treatment samples, we counted three 
slide transects (at ca. 1/4, 1/2, and 3/4 of the slide), and the sample counts 
were extrapolated to the total number of granules exposed to the samples over 16
days of treatments (see Supplementary Material for more details). For potato
treatment samples, the whole slide was counted.

### Extraction method

Extraction of starches from the calculus samples was performed by dissolving the
calculus in 0.5 $\tiny{M}$ ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) 
[@trompEDTACalculus2017; @lemoyneCalculusPretreatments2021; @modiCalculusMethodologies2020], 
and vortexing for 3 days until the sample was completely dissolved. 
Twenty $\mu$l of sample was mounted onto a slide with an 18x18 mm coverslip.
When transferring the sample to the slide, the sample was homogenised using 
the pipette to ensure that the counted transects were representative of the 
whole slide. The count from the slide was extrapolated to the whole sample
(see Supplementary Material for more detail).

Both wheat and potato granules were divided into three size categories: 
small (<10 $\mu$m), medium (10 -- 20 $\mu$m), and large (>20 $\mu$m). 

### Statistical analysis

Statistical analysis was conducted in `r version$version.string`  [@Rbase] and
the following packages: tidyverse [@tidyverse2019], broom [@Rbroom], 
here [@Rhere], and patchwork [@Rpatchwork].
<!-- R packages used -->

To see if biofilm growth was differently affected by starch treatments, a 
one-way ANOVA with sample weight as the dependent variable (DV) and treatment 
as the grouping variable (GV) was conducted.
To analyse granule counts and calculate size proportions, mean counts for each 
treatment were taken across
both experimental plates, resulting in a mean count for each
granule size category within each treatment.

Pearson's *r* was conducted on sample weight and total starch count, as well as sample
weight and starch count per mg calculus. The total count for each sample within a
treatment was standardised by z-score to account for the differences in magnitude
between the potato and wheat counts.
This was applied to total biofilm weight and starch count per mg 
calculus (also z-score standardised) to account for differences in starch 
concentration in the calculus [as per 
@wesolowskiEvaluatingMicrofossil2010].
