<!-- Big summary/important statement for the science -->
Here, we have provided a method for exploring the incorporation of dietary 
starches into the mineral matrix of a dental calculus biofilm model. Our results show
that a very low proportion of the starches exposed to the biofilm during growth are
retained in the mineral matrix, and that the size of the starch granules
may affect the likelihood of incorporation. The proportions of starch granules 
(of all sizes) present in the extracted samples were similar across all treatments
(`r paste(min(perc_tbl$total), max(perc_tbl$total), sep = " to ")`), 
despite large differences in absolute granule counts between wheat 
(mean = `r format(sol_comb_out$total[5], big.mark = ",")`) 
and potato
(mean = `r format(sol_comb_out$total[4], big.mark = ",")`)
solutions.  
The absolute counts, however, differed more visibly between treatments and was
proportional with the total count of granules in the treatment solutions. Wheat 
and mixed solutions had the highest absolute mean count of starch granules, and 
also had the highest absolute mean count of starch granules extracted from the 
dental calculus
(Tables \@ref(tab:solution-count-tbl) and \@ref(tab:sample-count-tbl)).
This suggests that the starches that are more frequently consumed will be present
in higher quantities in the dental calculus, at least prior to inhumation and 
degradation in the burial environment. 
Despite the low proportion of granules recovered from the model calculus 
(`r paste(min(perc_tbl$total), max(perc_tbl$total), sep = " to ")`),
the absolute counts were still substantially greater than counts recovered from 
archaeological remains 
[@trompDietaryNondietary2015; @trompEDTACalculus2017; @wesolowskiEvaluatingMicrofossilContent2010], which could in part be due to the 
lack of oral amylase activity in our model. 
<!-- Scientific findings as extension of previous work -->
Previous research conducted on dental calculus from contemporary humans and non-human
primates suggest a high level of stochasticity involved in the retention of 
starch granules in dental calculus, and that starch granules extracted from dental 
calculus are underrepresented with regard
to actual starch intake, which is consistent with our findings (illustrated by high
standard deviations and low proportional incorporation).
Leonard and colleagues [-@leonardDentalCalculus2015] found individual
calculus samples to be a poor predictor of diet in a population, as many of the 
consumed plants were missing from some individual samples, but were present in others.   
Power and colleagues [-@powerChimpCalculus2015] 
presented similar findings in non-human primates, where phytoliths were more
representative of individual diets than starch granules.
The size bias is also consistent with the findings by Power and colleagues
[-@powerChimpCalculus2015],
who found that plants producing starches 10--20 $\mu$m in
size were over-represented; however, the representation of granules larger than
20 $\mu$m in their study is unclear.

We have also shown that the size of the starch granules influences the likelihood
of incorporation into the calculus. Starch granules larger than 20 $\mu$m in
maximum length were underrepresented in the calculus samples compared to the original 
starch solutions, an effect that was consistent across all three treatments. Medium
granules (10--20 $\mu$m) were often over-represented
(Table \@ref(tab:sample-prop-tbl), 
and 
Figure \@ref(fig:ratio-plots)).
Large potato granules were most affected, potentially because of the greater
size-range. They can reach up to 100 $\mu$m in maximum length, whereas wheat 
granules generally only reach up to 35 $\mu$m 
[@gismondiStarchGranulesData2019; @haslamDecompositionStarch2004; @seidemannStarchAtlas1966, 174-176].
Granule morphology may also play a role. Large wheat granules 
are lenticular and have a larger surface area compared 
to volume, whereas large potato granules are ovoid and have a larger volume
compared to surface area 
[@vandeveldeStarchMorphology2002; @janeAnthologyStarch1994; @reichertStarchBible1913b, 364-365; @seidemannStarchAtlas1966, 174-176]. 
Another potentially important factor 
from our results is the size of the calculus deposit. We found a 
`r strength_cor` `r direct_cor` correlation between biofilm size and retained 
starch granules (Figure \@ref(fig:cor-plot)A);
a result that contradicts findings from archaeological contexts
[@wesolowskiEvaluatingMicrofossilContent2010; @dudgeonDietGeography2014].
When the concentration of starch granules
per mg calculus is considered, the correlation is weaker, but still present
(Figure \@ref(fig:cor-plot)B).
While the larger deposits contain a higher absolute count, our findings also suggest
that they contain a slightly higher concentration of starches. This may also explain
the lower mean retention of starch granules in mixed treatments compared to
wheat treatments. Wheat treatment samples (mean = `r subset(anova_tbl, treatment == "wheat")$mean` mg) were on average larger than mixed treatment samples (mean = `r subset(anova_tbl, treatment == "mix")$mean` mg) (Table \@ref(tab:anova-tbl)); and while mixed treatment solutions contained the highest mean overall
granule counts, wheat treatment samples had the highest mean starch retention.
Further research is needed to determine why this differs from previous archaeological
findings.

<!-- How are starch granules trapped in dental calculus? Does anyone actually know? 
-->
The mechanism by which starch granules are incorporated into plaque and calculus 
remains largely unknown, and few studies have directly investigated potential
mechanisms. We know that a proportion of the starch granules entering 
the mouth can become trapped in the plaque/calculus, and can be recovered from
archaeological samples of considerable age 
[@henryNeanderthalCalculus2014; @buckleyDentalCalculus2014; @wuDietEarliest2021]. 
Studies have also shown that not all starch granules come from a dietary source. 
Other pathways include cross-contamination from plant interactions in soil, such 
as palm phytoliths adhering to the skin of sweet potatoes 
[@trompDietaryNondietary2015], 
or accidental ingestion not related to food consumption 
[@radiniFoodPathways2017; @radiniMedievalWomenEarly2019].  
When starch granules enter the mouth, whether through ingestion of food or accidental
intake, they immediately encounter multiple obstacles. It is likely
that the bulk of starch granules are swallowed along with the food, and are 
only briefly present in the oral cavity. Other granules that are broken off
during mastication may be retained in the dentition through attachment to 
tooth surfaces (including plaque and dental calculus) and mucous membranes 
[@kashketFoodRetention1991; @doddsCarbohydrateRetention1988].
Bacteria also have the ability to adhere to starch granules 
[@toppingResistantStarch2003],
which would allow starches to attach to bacterial communities within the biofilm.
These granules are then
susceptible to mechanical removal by the tongue, salivary clearance, and hydrolysis
by $\alpha$-amylase [@kashketFoodParticles1996].
The susceptibility of granules to hydrolysis depends on the crystallinity and size
of the starch granule, as well as the mode of processing. Smaller and pre-processed
(e.g., cooked) starch granules are more susceptible to enzymatic degradation, 
while dehydrated starches will have a reduced susceptibility
[@lingstromStarchyFood1994; @francoStarchDegradation1992; @haslamDecompositionStarch2004; 
@bjorckStarchProcessing1984; @henryCookingStarch2009].
Cracks on the surface of the dental calculus, as well as unmineralised islands 
and channels may also be able to contain starch granules 
[@powerSEMCalculus2014; @tanCalculusUltrastructure2004; @charlierSEMCalculus2010].
Starch granules that are trapped in these pockets are (at least to some extent) 
protected from aforementioned clearance mechanisms, especially once
a new layer of plaque has covered the surface of the plaque/calculus. 
The size bias against large granules (>20 $\mu$m) from both wheat and potato 
(Table \@ref(tab:sample-prop-tbl)) may give further credence to
this incorporation pathway, as the smaller starch granules have an advantage over
larger granules, and can be stored in larger quantities.
This was also suggested by Power and colleagues [-@powerSEMCalculus2014], who
observed clusters of starches within dental calculus, rather than an even 
distribution across the surface of the dental calculus.
Granules trapped 
in plaque/calculus may still be susceptible to hydrolysis, as $\alpha$-amylase has
the ability to bind to both tooth enamel and bacteria within a biofilm and retain
a portion of its hydrolytic activity
[@scannapiecoSalivaryAmylase1993; @nikitkovaStarchBiofilms2013; @tanBacterialViability2004; @tanCalculusUltrastructure2004].
After the death of an individual, starches within dental calculus are susceptible 
to further degradation by post-depositional processes, depending on burial environment 
(pH, temperature, moisture content, microorganisms)
[@henryCookingStarch2009; @graneroStarchTaphonomy2020; @haslamDecompositionStarch2004; @francoStarchDegradation1992].
Future study should explore how burial affects the recovery of starch from the
biofilm model. <!-- I may get to it eventually, but it would be great if someone else could look at this! -->

<!-- in summary: we know very little about the mechanism behind how starches 
become trapped in dental calculus, but it would be nice to find out more. -->

<!-- limitations of the platform show which questions would be unanswered -->
The absence of $\alpha$-amylase in the model is a limitation of this study, as 
the total granule counts were not subject to hydrolysis. This would likely have 
reduced and affected the size ratios, as smaller starches may be more 
susceptible to hydrolysis 
[@francoStarchDegradation1992; @haslamDecompositionStarch2004]. The absence may
also affect biofilm growth due to the lack of amylase-bacterium interactions
[@nikitkovaStarchBiofilms2013]. Conversely, the model may benefit from the
absence of $\alpha$-amylase, because it can allow us to directly explore
its effect on starch counts in future experiments, where $\alpha$-amylase can be 
added to the model in concentrations similar to those found in the oral cavity
[@scannapiecoSalivaryAmylase1993]. 
We are able to show how absolute counts in the treatments cause a difference in
incorporation. However, this
was merely a side-effect of the difference in the number of granules in potato and 
wheat solutions of the same concentration (w/v). Further research should test 
multiple differing concentrations of the same starch type.
The use of EDTA may also have affected counts. While previous studies have shown 
negligible morphological changes caused by exposure to EDTA 
[@trompEDTACalculus2017; @lemoyneCalculusPretreatments2021; @modiCalculusMethodologies2020], 
these studies have not considered changes to separate size
categories within starch types, and whether shifts in size ratios occur due to
exposure to the pre-treatment chemicals.
The total number of granules on a slide often exceeded a number that 
was feasible to count in a reasonable time period, so we calculated the total 
counts by extrapolating from three slide transects. 
Thus, we reasonably assume that the three transects are a good representation 
of the entire slide, and that the distribution of all granules on the slide is 
relatively homogeneous.   
Finally, we only used native starches in the experimental procedure and the results 
will likely differ for processed starches [@graneroStarchTaphonomy2020]. 
Based on the comparatively low counts obtained by Leonard
and colleagues [-@leonardDentalCalculus2015, Supplement 2], processing and amylase
may have a substantial effect on starch granule retention in the oral cavity.

<!-- How this engineering will facilitate future research -->

While we are unable to sufficiently address the 
mechanism(s) of starch incorporation with the data obtained in this study, 
the dental calculus model presented here is uniquely suited to explore 
these questions and may improve interpretations of dietary practices in past 
populations. Further analyses using this model can address the call for more 
baseline testing of biases associated with dietary research conducted on dental calculus 
[@lemoyneCalculusPretreatments2021].
Our high-throughput experimental setup allows us a
higher degree of control over the factors that influence starch incorporation and
retention, such as dietary intake, differential survivability of starches, 
and inter- and intra-individual variation in plaque accumulation and mineralisation.
The latter is especially difficult to control *in vivo* as it is influenced by 
numerous factors including genetics, diet, salivary flow, and tooth position and
morphology 
[@jepsenCalculusRemoval2011; @simon-soroOralGeography2013; @proctorSpatialGradient2018; @fagernasMicrobialBiogeography2021; @haffajeeBiofilmPosition2009], 
as well as evolutionary differences [@yatesOralMicrobiome2021].
It can also facilitate training of students and researchers on methods of 
dental calculus analysis, such as starch and phytolith extraction and 
identification, where it can replace the use of finite archaeological resources.
