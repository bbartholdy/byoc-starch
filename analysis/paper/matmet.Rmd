## Biofilm formation

In this study we employ a multispecies oral biofilm model following a modified
protocol from Sissons and colleagues [-@sissonsMultistationDentalPlaque1991] and
Shellis [-@shellisSyntheticSalivaCultural1978]. The setup comprises a polypropylene 
24 deepwell PCR plate (KingFisher 97003510) with a lid containing 24 pegs (substrata), which 
is autoclaved at 120&deg;C, 1 bar overpressure, for 20 mins.
 
The artificial saliva (AS) is a modified version of the basal medium mucin (BMM)
described by Sissons and colleagues [-@sissonsMultistationDentalPlaque1991]. 
It contains 2.5 g/l partially purified mucin from porcine stomach (Type III, Sigma M1778), 
5 g/l trypticase peptone (Roth 2363.1), 10 g/l proteose peptone (Oxoid LP0085),
5 g/l yeast extract (BD 211921), 2.5 g/l KCl, 0.35 g/l NaCl, 1.8 mmol/l CaCl~2~, 
5.2 mmol/l Na~2~HPO~4~ [@sissonsMultistationDentalPlaque1991], 6.4 mmol/l NaHCO~3~ 
[@shellisSyntheticSalivaCultural1978], 2.5 mg/l haemin. This is subsequently 
adjusted to pH 7 with NaOH pellets and stirring, autoclaved (15 min, 120&deg;C, 
1 bar overpressure), and supplemented with 5.8 $\mu$mol/l menadione, 5 mmol/l urea, 
and 1 mmol/l arginine [@sissonsMultistationDentalPlaque1991].

Fresh whole saliva (WS) for inoculation was provided by a 31-year-old male donor 
with no history of caries, who abstained from oral hygiene for 24 hours, and no 
food was consumed two hours prior to donation. No antibiotics were taken up to six 
months prior to donation. 
The saliva was filtered through a sterilised (with bleach) nylon cloth to remove
particulates.
Substrata were inoculated with 1 ml/well of a two-fold dilution of WS in sterilised 
20% glycerine for four hours at 36&deg;C, to allow attachment of the
salivary pellicle and plaque-forming bacteria. After initial inoculation, the 
substrata were transferred to a new plate containing 1 ml/well AS and incubated 
at 36&deg;C, 30 rpm. The inoculation process was repeated on days 3 and 5. 
AS was partially refreshed once per day and fully refreshed every three days, 
throughout the experiment, by transferring the substrata to a new plate containing 
AS. To feed the bacteria, the substrata were transferred to a new plate, containing 
5% (w/v) sucrose, for six minutes twice daily, except on inoculation days 
(days 0, 3, and 5), where the samples only received one sucrose treatment after
inoculation. 

Starch treatments were initiated on day 9 to avoid starch granule counts being 
affected by $\alpha$-amylase hydrolysis. An $\alpha$-amylase (EC 3.2.1.1) activity
assay was conducted to confirm that no amylase was present in the system (see 
Bartholdy et al. ???? <!-- ## [bartholdy] ## --> for more details). Starch treatments replaced sucrose treatments, occurring twice per day
for six minutes. The starch treatments involved transferring the substrata to a 
new plate containing a 0.25% (w/v) starch from potato (Roth 9441.1) solution, a 0.25% (w/v) starch from wheat (Sigma S5127) solution, and a 0.5% (w/v) mixture of equal
concentrations (w/v) wheat and potato. All starch solutions were created in a 5%
(w/v) sucrose solution. Before transferring biofilm samples to the starch treatments, 
the starch plates were agitated to keep the starches in suspension in the solutions, 
and during treatments, the rpm was increased to 60.

After 15 days, mineralisation was encouraged with a 
calcium phosphate monofluorophosphate urea (CPMU) solution containing 
20 mmol/l CaCl~2~, 12 mmol/l NaH~2~PO~4~, 5 mmol/l Na~2~PO~3~F, 500 mmol/l Urea
[@pearceConcomitantDepositionStrontium1987; @sissonsMultistationDentalPlaque1991], 
and (0.04 g/l MgCl). The substrata were submerged in 1 ml/well CPMU five times daily, 
every two hours, for six minutes. During the mineralisation period, starch treatments
were reduced to once per day after the five CPMU treatments. This cycle was repeated 
for 10 days until the end of the experiment on day 24 
(see \@ref(fig:protocol-fig) for an overview of protocol). More detailed protocols
are available on protocols.io<!--insert DOI-->.

All laboratory work was conducted in sterile conditions under a laminar flow hood 
to prevent starch and bacterial contamination. Control samples were included to 
detect starch contamination.

## Starch counts

Starch granule counts were divided into three size categories: small (<10 $\mu$m),
medium (10 -- 20 $\mu$m), and large (>20 $\mu$m). Counts for small wheat and
potato starches were combined for the mixed treatment samples, as it is not 
possible to distinguish the small starch granules between the two species.

### Treatment solutions

A 1 ml aliquot of each starch solution was taken, from which 10 $\mu$l was mounted 
on a microscope slide with an 18 x 18 mm coverslip, and counted under a light microscope
(Zeiss Axioscope A1). Counting starches on a full slide was not feasible, so three slide transects were 
counted (at 1/3, 1/2, and 2/3 of the slide), and the sample counts were extrapolated 
(see Supplementary material for more details).

### Extraction from samples

Extraction of starches from the calculus samples was performed by dissolving the
calculus in ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA), as it has been shown to
have little to no effect on starch granules (especially native granules)
[@trompEDTACalculus2017; @lemoyneCalculusPretreatments2021; @modiCalculusMethodologies2020], 
and vortexing for 3 days until the sample was completely dissolved. 
Twenty $\mu$l of sample was mounted onto a slide with an 18x18 mm coverslip.
When dispersing the liquid (EDTA) sample on the slide, the sample was homogenised using the pipette. 
It was not possible to count all wheat starches
on a slide, so wheat and mix counts were extrapolated as described for the treatment
solutions.

## Statistical analysis

Statistical analysis was conducted in R versions 4.0.5 ("Shake and Throw") 
and 4.0.3 ("Bunny-Wunnies Freak Out") [@R-base].
<!-- R packages used -->
A one-way ANOVA with sample weight as the dependent variable (DV) and treatment 
as the grouping variable (GV) was conducted to explore the effect of the different 
starch treatments on biofilm growth.

To calculate size proportions, mean counts for each treatment were taken across 
both experimental plates for each treatment, resulting in a mean count for each
granule size category within each treatment.

Pearson's r was conducted on sample weight and total starch count, as well as sample
weight and starch count per mg calculus. The total count for each sample within a
treatment was standardised by z-score to account for the differences in magnitude
between the potato and wheat counts.
